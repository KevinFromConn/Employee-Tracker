# Kevin's Employee Tracker

This application will allow the user to manage and track employees, as well as their respective roles and departments, within a company. All done through the command line, the user will be able to:
1). View all departments, roles and employees,
2). Add a new department, role and/or employee, and
3). Update the role of an existing employee, including the new salary the role may come with.

The information entered using Node.js and Inquirer will be stored on a database created and maintained with MySQL. In future updates, the user will also be able to update an existing employee's manager, view employees grouped by manager, view employees grouped by department, delete existing departments, roles and employees entirely, and view the total budget of a given department by adding up the salaries of every employee in said department.
